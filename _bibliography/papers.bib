  title={Using IPA-Based Tacotron for Data Efficient Cross-Lingual Speaker Adaptation and Pronunciation Enhancement},
  author={Hemati, H. and Borth, D.},
  abstract={Recent neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have been shown to perform very well when enough data is available. However, fine-tuning them towards a new speaker or a new language is not as straight-forward in a low-resource setup. In this paper, we show that by applying minor changes to a Tacotron model, one can transfer an existing TTS model for a new speaker with the same or a different language using only 20 minutes of data. For this purpose, we first introduce a baseline multi-lingual Tacotron with language-agnostic input, then show how transfer learning is done for different scenarios of speaker adaptation without exploiting any pre-trained speaker encoder or code-switching technique. We evaluate the transferred model in both subjective and objective ways.},
