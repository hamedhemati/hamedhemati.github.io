### About Me
I'm a PhD student in the [AI:ML](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/) lab at the University of St. Gallen working under the supervision of [Prof. Damian Borth](https://www.unisg.ch/en/personenverzeichnis/31286cca-f810-49c7-9300-51149d93e1da). I'm interested in designing models that learn from few amount of data by exploiting prior knowledge and enabling them to learn continually by adapting to new tasks without forgetting what they are currently good at.

### Research Interests
- Meta Learning (Few-Shot Learning)
- Contintual Learning
- Generative Modeling
- Zero-Shot Learning
